# boids

A Quil sketch designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## TODO
    - Give boids a intial velocity
    - Rework heading
        - remove initial random heading, calculate base on velocity
        - Decide whether to store heading in state (probably not)
    - Finish steering logic (maybe put in new namespace)
    -Change heading angle to radians
